# Getting started

The Nuklear library is a cool tool that will help you building customized and responsive very-complex components and add them to your website with the highest simplicity.

## Importing the library

The only thing you need to do is import the library in your html page. In the `head` tag put these lines.

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://maruchero.github.io/nuklear/style/all.css">
<script src="https://maruchero.github.io/nuklear/script/all.js"></script>
```

These lines will load the library before the page loads, so you will be able to use it immediately.
